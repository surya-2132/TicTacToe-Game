# TicTacToe-Game

Core Java was used to develop the backend logic for this Java mini project.
Additionally, this minigame has a frontend, for which we utilized pretty simple Java fxml.
It's a fun-filled childhood game that we used to play at recess. 
I made this with my soft knowledge as a fun portion of my programming part.
